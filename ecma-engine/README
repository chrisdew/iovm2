eval for arbitrary code execution
getDefinitionByName for class retrieval
new for creating instances
[] for getting properties
hasOwnProperty for checking properties
for in for enumerating properties


Packaging:
1. Place Io code in EXML literal inside *.as file[s]
2. Compile SWF from the AST


Deviations from the mainline Io:

1. Square brackets instead fo parentheses
2. Method name may have "=", "?" or "!" in the end
3. Only one type of assignment: A = B
4. Assignment invokes "A=[B]" method instead of "setSlot['A', B]"
5. Slot is marked as activatable, rather than value. This allows to pass methods as first class objects without using "getSlot" to avoid activation.

Basically, object does not have slots anymore. It is just a collection of methods.

callMethod["name"]           #=> ""
callMethod["name=", "Oleg"]  #=> "Oleg"
getMethod["name"]            #=> __get_name
getMethod["name="]           #=> __set_name
setMethod["name",  method[_name]]
setMethod["name=", method[n, _name = n]]

Note: when "name=" method is called, the argument is always returned. Even if callMethod["name="] was used.
      For consistency it is recommended to explicitely return value from the "a="-kind method

syntactic sugar:

def[name, arg1, arg2, arg1 + arg2]: creates and assigns the method
Object setMethod["def", 
  method[
    setMethod[name, 
      call locals doMessage[
        message[method] setArguments[call arguments tail]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
