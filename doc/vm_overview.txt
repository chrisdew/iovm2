1. interpreter loads and parses the code, creates message tree
2. interpreter walks through the message tree, emits and immediately interprets bytecode
3. interpreter counts number of calls at each message
4. interpreter collects statistics at control points: method lookup, conditional expression.
   statistics are stored in a hash table with an upper boundary. 
5. when statistics show up leading value(s) (e.g. method A was called 95 times, method B - 5)
   interpreter appends guard with a test for such leading value to the bytecode and bytecode
   of the next message.
6. First time bytecode is enlarged (trace is constructed), it is passed to the cyclic chain of optimizing filters.
7. Each time bytecode is executed, only one step in the filter chain is passed. 
8. After each whole filter cycle, bytecode digest is computed.
9. If the digest does not change (code is optimized), filters are switched off until trace is enlarged.
10. When optimization is finished, native code compiler is invoked for the resulting bytecode.

   Example:
     first pass - create bytecode
     N     pass - append next message bytecode (create a trace)
     N + 1 pass - pass to the filter F1
     N + 2 pass - pass to the filter F2
     N + 3 pass - pass to the filter F3
                  compute the digest
     N + 4 pass - pass to the filter F1
     N + 5 pass - pass to the filter F2
     N + 6 pass - pass to the filter F3
                  compute the digest
                  if not changed - switch off the filters, 
                                   run native code compiler.

Note: digest computation and NCC invocation could be implemented as another filter.

11. If situation is changed and some branch drops below the threshold,
    its branch is dropped off to free up the memory.
